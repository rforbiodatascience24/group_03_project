04_PCA_analysis.R
PCA-analysis
We will perform a PCA analysis on the data set to see if we can reduce the dimensionality of the data set.
We will then plot the data set in 2D and 3D to see if we can see any patterns in the data set.

## Project Description

Our project is analyzing data from 130 US Hospitals in the years 1999-2008. The used dataset focuses on patients with diabetes who had laboratory tests, received medications, and had a hospital stay up to 14 days. The data set includes 101.766 instances, where each instance is one visit to the hospital by a diabetes patient.

The data is analysed to show BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA
