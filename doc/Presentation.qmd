## Introduction

## Materials

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
**Raw**

-   Diabetes data
    -   101766 encounters across 71518 patients
    -   Example columns: age, gender, race, diagnoses, admission and discharge
-   IDs mapping
-   ICD9 - International classification of diseases
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
**Joining**

-   Keep all diabetes data
-   Values without translations are kept numbers

**Augmentation**

-   Add nr_encounters
-   Add time_in_hospital
:::
:::

## Methods

-   With the augmented data ---\> examine tendencies

-   Finding patters for characteristics, diagnoses

-   Purpose of project: *Are there any common factors leading to admissions into hospital, with focus on diabetes patients?*

## Parameter examination

-   Plots, and their significance

## Shiny app for further examination

App showing number of readmissions across different parameters in the dataset.

-   filters:

    -   Race

    -   Gender

    -   Medication

## PCA analysis

## Results

-   Average number of diagnoses rises with age

-   Most common primary diagnosis: *Coronary atherosclerosis* - buildup of fats, cholesterol and other substances in and on the walls of the heart arteries

    -   Very common for diabetes patients

-   Most common diabetes complication: *Neurological manifestations* - damage to nerve endings, results in pain and numbness in legs, feet and hands

    -   Has many problematic side effects, such as chronic foot ulcers, digestive issues etc.

-   For patients with uncontrolled diabetes, *Ketoacidosis* was more common, which is caused by lack of insulin in the body

## Discussion
