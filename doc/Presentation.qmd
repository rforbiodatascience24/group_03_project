## Introduction

::: r-fit-text
-   **Exploring Patterns**:\
    Identifying trends and tendencies in diabetes patients to improve understanding of hospital admissions.

### Objectives

1.  **Identify Common Factors**:\
    Understand the key factors and primary diagnoses leading to hospital admissions among diabetes patients.

2.  **Frequent Side Diagnoses**:\
    Investigate the most common secondary diagnoses accompanying hospital admissions.

3.  **Effective Medications**:\
    Determine which medications are most effective at preventing readmissions.
:::

## Methods and Materials

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
**Raw**

-   Diabetes data
    -   101766 encounters across 71518 patients
    -   Example columns: age, gender, race, diagnoses, admission and discharge
-   IDs mapping
-   ICD9 - International classification of diseases
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
**Joining**

-   Keep all diabetes data
-   Values without translations are kept numbers

**Augmentation**

-   Add nr_encounters
-   Add time_in_hospital

## Parameter examination

### Average diagnoses amount by age

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Most common primary diagnosis across visits

### Patients with diabetes as primary or secondary diagnoses for visit

## Shiny App for Further Examination

-   **Purpose**:\
    A dynamic app to explore the number of hospital readmissions across various parameters in the data set.

### Filters Available:

1.  **Race**

2.  **Gender**

3.  **Medication**

## PCA analysis

::: r-fit-text
-   The PCA reduces the dimensionality of our dataset, so that we can easier group patients with similar characteristics.

-   PC1 (25% of variance) likely represent interactions with hospitals (encounters, num_emergencies) while PC2 (17% of variance) likely represent intensity or difficulty of treatment (time_in_hospital, num_medications, num_procedures)

    -   We therefore can split patients into smaller segments

-   By K-means clustering based on the PCA we get three major groups of patients

    -   "Insert small description of each cluster"
:::

## Results

::: r-fit-text
-   Average number of diagnoses rises with age

-   Most common primary diagnosis: *Coronary atherosclerosis* - buildup of fats, cholesterol and other substances in and on the walls of the heart arteries

    -   Very common for diabetes patients

-   Most common diabetes complication: *Neurological manifestations* - damage to nerve endings, results in pain and numbness in legs, feet and hands

    -   Has many problematic side effects, such as chronic foot ulcers, digestive issues etc.

-   For patients with uncontrolled diabetes, *Ketoacidosis* was more common, which is caused by lack of insulin in the body
