## Introduction

-   Diabetes data

    -   101766 encounters

    -   71518 patients

    -   Example columns: age, gender, race, diagnoses, admission and discharge

-   ICD9

    -   International classification of diseases

## Materials and methods

-   With the augmented data —\> examine tendencies

-   Finding patters for characteristics, diagnoses

-   Purpose of project: *Are there any common factors leading to admissions into hospital, with focus on diabetes patients?*

## Parameter examination

-   Plots, and their significance

## Shiny app for further examination

## PCA analysis

## Results

-   Average number of diagnoses rises with age

-   Most common primary diagnosis: *Coronary atherosclerosis* - buildup of fats, cholesterol and other substances in and on the walls of the heart arteries

    -   Very common for diabetes patients

-   Most common diabetes complication: *Neurological manifestations* - damage to nerve endings, results in pain and numbness in legs, feet and hands

    -   Has many problematic side effects, such as chronic foot ulcers, digestive issues etc.

-   For patients with uncontrolled diabetes, *Ketoacidosis* was more common, which is caused by lack of insulin in the body
