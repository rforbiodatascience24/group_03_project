## Introduction

::: r-fit-text
### **Goal: Exploring Patterns**

-   Identifying trends and tendencies in diabetes patients to improve understanding of hospital admissions.

### Objectives

1.  **Identify Common Factors**:\
    Understand the key factors and primary diagnoses leading to hospital admissions among diabetes patients.

2.  **Frequent Side Diagnoses**:\
    Investigate the most common secondary diagnoses accompanying hospital admissions.

3.  **Effective Medications**:\
    Determine which medications are most effective at preventing readmission.

## Methods and Materials

:::::::: r-fit-text
:::::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
**Raw**

-   Diabetes data
    -   101766 encounters across 71518 patients
    -   Example columns: age, gender, race, diagnoses, admission and discharge
-   IDs mapping
-   ICD9 - International classification of diseases

**Joining**

-   Keep all diabetes data
-   Values without translations are kept numbers
:::

::: {.column width="5%"}
:::

::: {.column width="35%"}
**Augmentation**

-   Add nr_encounters
-   Add time_in_hospital

**Analysis**

-   Visualizations
-   PCA

## Shiny App for dynamic data examination

::::::: r-fit-text
**Purpose**:\
A dynamic app to explore the number of hospital readmissions across various parameters in the data set.

**Filters Available:**

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="32%"}
1.  Readmission status

2.  Age
:::

::: {.column width="32%"}
3.  Race

4.  Gender

::: {.column width="32%"}
5.  Medications

## PCA analysis

:::::: r-fit-text
::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   The PCA reduces the dimensionality of our data set, so that we can easier group patients with similar characteristics.

-   PC1 (25% of variance) likely represent interactions with hospitals (encounters, num_emergencies) while PC2 (17% of variance) likely represent intensity or difficulty of treatment (time_in_hospital, num_medications, num_procedures)

    -   We therefore can split patients into smaller segments

-   By K-means clustering based on the PCA we get three major groups of patients

## Results

:::: r-fit-text
-   Average number of diagnoses rises with age

-   Most common primary diagnosis: *Coronary atherosclerosis* - buildup of fats, cholesterol and other substances in and on the walls of the heart arteries

    -   Very common for diabetes patients

-   Most common diabetes complication: *Neurological manifestations* - damage to nerve endings, results in pain and numbness in legs, feet and hands

    -   Has many problematic side effects, such as chronic foot ulcers, digestive issues etc.

-   For patients with uncontrolled diabetes, *Ketoacidosis* was more common, which is caused by lack of insulin in the body

-   Which medication had the lowest amount of readmission in the age group (30-40\] for Asian patients

## Discussion

:::: r-fit-text
-   It is inherently logical that the amount of diagnoses increases with age. This is especially given seeing as the most common diagnosis is *Coronary atherosclerosis,* which is much more commonly seen in elderly people.
-   *Coronary atherosclerosis* and *Neurological manifestations* are often more prevalent and worsened by obesity, a common cause of diabetes type II.
-   When diabetes was uncontrolled among patients, *ketoacidosis* was a much more common diagnosis when admitted to hospital, obviously caused by the patients not properly administering their disease and therefore lacking insulin.
